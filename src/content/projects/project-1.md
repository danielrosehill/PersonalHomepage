<b>Once upon a time</b> when this sounded like a small undertaking that could be finished in a week or two, I decided to set up a web portal to gather data of interest about 'impact' and (in its narrower construct) impact investing. I couldn't bring myself to use lifeless stock imagery so I decided to begin running prompts through DALLE. Lo and behold, the website has taken on a distinctive theme! 

The website's purpose is multifold:

On the one hand, I try to gather and organise datapoints about subjects related to the 'impact' movement (themes are generally at the intersection between sustainability and finance). 

On the other, I'm always exploring interesting new ways to visualise and present the narrative beneath the data layer. 

It's a non-profit venture that I'm enjoying immensely and which bleeds into my professional responsibilities.

Technically, it's been both a challenging and rewarding project and has involved lots of hands-on work trying to make databases and APIs and frameworks be happy and compliant.
